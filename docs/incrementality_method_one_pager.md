# CRM Incrementality Measurement — One-Pager

## Purpose
This document describes the **directional CRM incrementality methodology** used to estimate the business impact of CRM communications when a randomized control group is not available.

The objective is to support **decision-making and prioritization**, not to provide causal proof.

## Core Concept (No Control Group)
Incrementality is estimated by comparing each customer’s behavior **after CRM exposure (POST)** to their **own historical behavior (PRE baseline)**.

This within-customer comparison reduces structural bias and enables scalable measurement across the full customer base.

## Key Formula
**Incremental Revenue (proxy)**
